# Raylib C/C++ Template
Game template for [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html) and Visual Studio (tested on VS2019, should work on 2022 too)

This template should work out-of-the-box. Just download the repo and open `raylib-template.sln`.

### Building from command line
You don't have to open VS to build the project. Just run `msbuild raylib-template.sln`.\
**Warning**: you **have** to use the `Developer command prompt for VS`, otherwise this won't work!
